# Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automatically detect fake news from a given news corpus. In this hands-on project, we will train a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM-based model to classify news articles as either "Fake" or "Real." This system can be used by media companies to efficiently analyze large volumes of news content and predict its credibility without requiring manual review of thousands of articles.

### Key Features:

-   Train a Bidirectional Neural Network with LSTM for Fake News Detection.
-   Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning to prepare the dataset.
-   Tokenize and pad text data to prepare it for model training.
-   Understand the intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
-   Visualize and assess the modelâ€™s performance on real-world data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a labeled news corpus that contains articles tagged as either real or fake. This dataset will be cleaned, preprocessed, and tokenized to be used in the deep learning model.

## Project Steps

1.  **Understand the Problem Statement:**
    
    -   Learn about the business case for Fake News Detection and how media companies can benefit from an automated solution.
2.  **Import Libraries and Datasets:**
    
    -   Use popular Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
    -   Load the dataset and prepare it for analysis.
3.  **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    
    -   Analyze the structure and content of the dataset.
    -   Visualize patterns in the data to gain insights into real vs. fake news.
4.  **Data Cleaning:**
    
    -   Remove missing values, duplicate entries, and perform text cleaning (removing special characters, lowercasing, etc.).
5.  **Data Visualization:**
    
    -   Visualize word distributions and other features that may help differentiate between real and fake news.
6.  **Tokenizing and Padding the Data:**
    
    -   Convert the text data into numerical format using tokenization.
    -   Use padding to ensure all input sequences have the same length.
7.  **Understand RNN and LSTM Theory:**
    
    -   Learn the intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, which help capture long-term dependencies in text.
8.  **Build and Train the Model:**
    
    -   Construct a Bidirectional LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras.
    -   Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
9.  **Assess Model Performance:**
    
    -   Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
    -   Visualize the performance of the trained model.
